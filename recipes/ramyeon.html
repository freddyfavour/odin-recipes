        <li>1/2 cup carrots, julienned</li>

        <li>Sesame seeds and nori (seaweed) for garnish</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="recipe_subheading">Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat vegetable oil in a pot over medium heat. Add minced garlic and
          sautÃ© until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the Napa cabbage, mushrooms, and carrots to the pot. Stir-fry for
          a few minutes until the vegetables start to soften.
        </li>
        <li>Pour in the water and bring it to a boil.</li>
        <li>
          Once the water is boiling, add the ramyeon noodles and seasoning
          packets from the Shin Ramyun packs. If you prefer less spice, you can
          adjust the amount of the spicy seasoning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook the noodles according to the package instructions, usually for
          about 4-5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you like, you can crack eggs into the pot during the last 2 minutes
          of cooking. Allow them to poach in the broth.
        </li>
        <li>Add chopped green onions and stir.</li>
        <li>Once the noodles are cooked, remove the pot from heat.</li>
        <li>
          Serve the ramyeon in bowls, making sure to distribute the vegetables
          and broth evenly.
        </li>
        <li>Garnish with sesame seeds and torn nori sheets.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="final">
        Enjoy your Korean ramyeon! Feel free to add or modify the ingredients to
        suit your taste. Some people like to add kimchi, tofu, or even a slice
        of cheese for extra richness.
